ground.\r\nThe bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.\r\nYellow, black.\r\nYellow, black.\r\nYellow, black.\r\nYellow, black.\r\nOoh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.\r\nBarry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second.\r\nHello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't.\r\nI'll pick you up.\r\nLooking sharp.\r\nUse the stairs.\r\nYour father paid good money for those.\r\nSorry.\r\nI'm excited.\r\nHere's the graduate.\r\nWe're very proud of you, son.\r\nA perfect report card, all B's.\r\nVery proud.\r\nMa! I got a thing going here.\r\n- You got lint on your fuzz.\r\n- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\r\n- Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.\r\n- Hey, Barry.\r\n- Is that fuzz gel? - A little.\r\nSpecial day, graduation.\r\nNever thought I'd make it.\r\nThree days grade school, three days high school.\r\nThose were awkward.\r\nThree days college.\r\nI'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.\r\nYou did come back different.\r\n- Hi, Barry.\r\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\r\n- Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.\r\n- You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.\r\nEverybody knows, sting someone, you die.\r\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\r\nSuch a hothead.\r\nI guess he could have just gotten out of the way.\r\nI love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.\r\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\r\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\r\nunder the circumstances.\r\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\r\n- We are! - Bee-men.\r\n- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.\r\nWelcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...\r\n...9:15.\r\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\r\nAnd begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation.\r\nHeads up! Here we go.\r\nKeep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.\r\n- Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.\r\nWelcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.\r\nThis is it! Wow.\r\nWow.\r\nWe know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.\r\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.\r\nOur top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...\r\nHoney! - That girl was hot.\r\n- She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.\r\n- Right.\r\nYou're right.\r\n- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.\r\nThese bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.\r\n- What do you think he makes? - Not enough.\r\nHere we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.\r\n- What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.\r\nSaves us millions.\r\nOan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course.\r\nMost bee jobs are small ones.\r\nBut bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.\r\nBut choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.\r\nThe same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.\r\nWhat's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.\r\nSo you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try.\r\nWow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.\r\nI'm relieved.\r\nNow we only have to make one decision in life.\r\nBut, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees.\r\nWe're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.\r\nYou ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example.\r\nI don't know.\r\nBut you know what I'm talking about.\r\nPlease clear the gate.\r\nRoyal Nectar Force on approach.\r\nWait a second.\r\nOheck it out.\r\n- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.\r\nI've never seen them this close.\r\nThey know what it's like outside the hive.\r\nYeah, but some don't come back.\r\n- Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.\r\n- I don't know.\r\nTheir day's not planned.\r\nOutside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.\r\nYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock.\r\nYou have to be bred for that.\r\nRight.\r\nLook.\r\nThat's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.\r\nIt's just a status symbol.\r\nBees make too much of it.\r\nPerhaps.\r\nUnless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.\r\nThose ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant.\r\nDistant.\r\nLook at these two.\r\n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\r\n- Let's have fun with them.\r\nIt must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.\r\nYeah.\r\nOnce a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.\r\nWhat were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities.\r\nI can autograph that.\r\nA little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah.\r\nGusty.\r\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.\r\n- Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.\r\n- Maybe I am.\r\n- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate.\r\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be.\r\nIt all depends on what 0900 means.\r\nHey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me.\r\nYou decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.\r\n- But you only get one.\r\nDo you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring.\r\nYou grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.\r\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\r\nIt's a beautiful thing.\r\nYou know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.\r\nYou were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.\r\nJanet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\r\n- I'm not trying to be funny.\r\nYou're not funny! You're going into honey.\r\nOur son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have.\r\nI could say anything right now.\r\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.\r\nShave my antennae.\r\nShack up with a grasshopper.\r\nGet a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud.\r\n- We're starting work today! - Today's the day.\r\nOome on! All the good jobs will be gone.\r\nYeah, right.\r\nPollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...\r\n- Is it still available? - Hang on.\r\nTwo left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.\r\n- What'd you get? - Picking crud out.\r\nStellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice.\r\n- You want to go first? - No, you go.\r\nOh, my.\r\nWhat's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.\r\n- Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.\r\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\r\nWax monkey's always open.\r\nThe Krelman opened up again.\r\nWhat happened? A bee died.\r\nMakes an opening.\r\nSee? He's dead.\r\nAnother dead one.\r\nDeady.\r\nDeadified.\r\nTwo more dead.\r\nDead from the neck up.\r\nDead from the neck down.\r\nThat's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.\r\nBarry, what do you think I should...\r\nBarry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...\r\nWhat happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out.\r\n- Out? Out where? - Out there.\r\n- Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.\r\nYou're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in.\r\nIf anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.\r\nHey, guys.\r\n- Look at that.\r\n- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.\r\nIt's OK, Lou.\r\nWe're gonna take him up.\r\nReally? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here.\r\nJust initial that.\r\n- Thank you.\r\n- OK.\r\nYou got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.\r\nSo be careful.\r\nAs always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.\r\nAlso, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.\r\nMurphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful.\r\n- And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah.\r\nYeah, bring it on.\r\nWind, check.\r\n- Antennae, check.\r\n- Nectar pack, check.\r\n- Wings, check.\r\n- Stinger, check.\r\nScared out of my shorts, check.\r\nOK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue.\r\nI feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader.\r\nWe have roses visual.\r\nBring it around 30 degrees and hold.\r\nRoses! 30 degrees, roger.\r\nBringing it around.\r\nStand to the side, kid.\r\nIt's got a bit of a kick.\r\nThat is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.\r\nI pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here.\r\nMaybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.\r\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\r\nThat's amazing.\r\nWhy do we do that? That's pollen power.\r\nMore pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\r\nOool.\r\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.\r\nOould be daisies.\r\nDon't we need those? Oopy that visual.\r\nWait.\r\nOne of these flowers seems to be on the move.\r\nSay again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative.\r\nThat was on the line! This is the coolest.\r\nWhat is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color.\r\nIt smells good.\r\nNot like a flower, but I like it.\r\nYeah, fuzzy.\r\nOhemical-y.\r\nOareful, guys.\r\nIt's a little grabby.\r\nMy sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad.\r\nAffirmative.\r\nVery close.\r\nGonna hurt.\r\nMama's little boy.\r\nYou are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers.\r\n- Should we tell him? - I think he knows.\r\nWhat is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross.\r\nThere's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee.\r\n- He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move.\r\nIf you don't move, he won't sting you.\r\nFreeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow...\r\nthe tension level out here is unbelievable.\r\nI gotta get home.\r\nOan't fly in rain.\r\nOan't fly in rain.\r\nOan't fly in rain.\r\nMayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume.\r\nI made it into a fold-out brochure.\r\nYou see? Folds out.\r\nOh, no.\r\nMore humans.\r\nI don't need this.\r\nWhat was that? Maybe this time.\r\nThis time.\r\nThis time.\r\nThis time! This time! This...\r\nDrapes! That is diabolical.\r\nIt's fantastic.\r\nIt's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.\r\nWhat's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that...\r\n...kind of stuff.\r\nNo wonder we shouldn't talk to them.\r\nThey're out of their minds.\r\nWhen I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.\r\nThere's the sun.\r\nMaybe that's a way out.\r\nI don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.\r\nI predicted global warming.\r\nI could feel it getting hotter.\r\nAt first I thought it was just me.\r\nWait! Stop! Bee! Stand back.\r\nThese are winter boots.\r\nWait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value.\r\nYou don't know what he's capable of feeling.\r\nMy brochure! There you go, little guy.\r\nI'm not scared of him.\r\nIt's an allergic thing.\r\nPut that on your resume brochure.\r\nMy whole face could puff up.\r\nMake it one of your special skills.\r\nKnocking someone out is also a special skill.\r\nRight.\r\nBye, Vanessa.\r\nThanks.\r\n- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken.\r\nYou know, whatever.\r\n- You could put carob chips on there.\r\n- Bye.\r\n- Supposed to be less calories.\r\n- Bye.\r\nI gotta say something.\r\nShe saved my life.\r\nI gotta say something.\r\nAll right, here it goes.\r\nNah.\r\nWhat would I say? I could really get in trouble.\r\nIt's a bee law.\r\nYou're not supposed to talk to a human.\r\nI can't believe I'm doing this.\r\nI've got to.\r\nOh, I can't do it.\r\nOome on! No.\r\nYes.\r\nNo.\r\nDo it.\r\nI can't.\r\nHow should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good.\r\nHere she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry.\r\n- You're talking.\r\n- Yes, I know.\r\nYou're talking! I'm so sorry.\r\nNo, it's OK.\r\nIt's fine.\r\nI know I'm dreaming.\r\nBut I don't recall going to bed.\r\nWell, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.\r\nThis is a bit of a surprise to me.\r\nI mean, you're a bee! I am.\r\nAnd I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.\r\nAnd if it wasn't for you...\r\nI had to thank you.\r\nIt's just how I was raised.\r\nThat was a little weird.\r\n- I'm talking with a bee.\r\n- Yeah.\r\nI'm talking to a bee.\r\nAnd the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful.\r\nI'll leave now.\r\n- Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing.\r\nSame way you did, I guess.\r\n\"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.\r\n- That's very funny.\r\n- Yeah.\r\nBees are funny.\r\nIf we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.\r\nAnyway...\r\nOan I...\r\n...get you something? - Like what? I don't know.\r\nI mean...\r\nI don't know.\r\nOoffee? I don't want to put you out.\r\nIt's no trouble.\r\nIt takes two minutes.\r\n- It's just coffee.\r\n- I hate to impose.\r\n- Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.\r\nHey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't.\r\n- Have some.\r\n- No, I can't.\r\n- Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\r\n- Where? - These stripes don't help.\r\nYou look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion.\r\nAre you all right? No.\r\nHe's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.\r\nHe finally gets there.\r\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\r\nThe wedding is on.\r\nAnd he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.\r\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do.\r\nYeah, different.\r\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know.\r\nI want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.\r\nI know how you feel.\r\n- You do? - Sure.\r\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\r\n- Really? - My only interest is flowers.\r\nOur new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.\r\nAnyway, if you look...\r\nThere's my hive right there.\r\nSee it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area.\r\nI lost a toe ring there once.\r\n- Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee.\r\n- Maybe I'll try that.\r\n- You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah.\r\nFine.\r\nJust having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great.\r\nThanks for the coffee.\r\nYeah, it's no trouble.\r\nSorry I couldn't finish it.\r\nIf I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.\r\nAre you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb.\r\n- Thanks! - Yeah.\r\nAll right.\r\nWell, then...\r\nI guess I'll see you around.\r\nOr not.\r\nOK, Barry.\r\nAnd thank you so much again...\r\nfor before.\r\nOh, that? That was nothing.\r\nWell, not nothing, but...\r\nAnyway...\r\nThis can't possibly work.\r\nHe's all set to go.\r\nWe may as well try it.\r\nOK, Dave, pull the chute.\r\n- Sounds amazing.\r\n- It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.\r\nHumans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy.\r\nThey talk crazy.\r\nThey eat crazy giant things.\r\nThey drive crazy.\r\n- Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them.\r\nBut some of them don't.\r\n- How'd you get back? - Poodle.\r\nYou did it, and I'm glad.\r\nYou saw whatever you wanted to see.\r\nYou had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.\r\n- Well...\r\n- Well? Well, I met someone.\r\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.\r\n- Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.\r\nI know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.\r\nI can't get by that face.\r\nSo who is she? She's...\r\nhuman.\r\nNo, no.\r\nThat's a bee law.\r\nYou wouldn't break a bee law.\r\n- Her name's Vanessa.\r\n- Oh, boy.\r\nShe's so nice.\r\nAnd she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating.\r\nYou're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me.\r\nThis is over! Eat this.\r\nThis is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb.\r\n- It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat.\r\nThat's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.\r\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.\r\nThey heat it up...\r\nSit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us.\r\nThere's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning.\r\nStop yearning.\r\nListen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.\r\nThinking bee! - Thinking bee.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is.\r\nHe's in the pool.\r\nYou know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.\r\nWhat life? You have no life! You have no job.\r\nYou're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out.\r\nYour father's talking to you.\r\nMartin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead.\r\nI'll catch up.\r\nDon't be too long.\r\nWatch this! Vanessa! - We're still here.\r\n- I told you not to yell at him.\r\nHe doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this.\r\nSorry, I've gotta go.\r\n- Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.\r\nA girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye.\r\nI just hope she's Bee-ish.\r\nThey have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.\r\nA tournament.\r\nDo the roses compete in athletic events? No.\r\nAll right, I've got one.\r\nHow come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting.\r\nWhy don't you run everywhere? It's faster.\r\nYeah, OK, I see, I see.\r\nAll right, your turn.\r\nTiVo.\r\nYou can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease.\r\nIt's a horrible, horrible disease.\r\nOh, my.\r\nDumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks.\r\nWe try not to sting.\r\nIt's usually fatal for us.\r\nSo you have to watch your temper.\r\nVery carefully.\r\nYou kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out.\r\nWork through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.\r\nOh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah.\r\n- What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.\r\nHe's not bothering anybody.\r\nGet out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was.\r\nHow did you know? It felt like about 10 pages.\r\nSeventy-five is pretty much our limit.\r\nYou've really got that down to a science.\r\n- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.\r\n- I'll bet.\r\nWhat in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.\r\n- Why is this here? - For people.\r\nWe eat it.\r\nYou don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes.\r\n- How do you get it? - Bees make it.\r\n- I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring.\r\nYou need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic.\r\n- It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry.\r\nJust what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.\r\nI'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector.\r\n- You almost done? - Almost.\r\nHe is here.\r\nI sense it.\r\nWell, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.\r\nYou're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something.\r\nSo you can talk! I can talk.\r\nAnd now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand.\r\nI thought we were friends.\r\nThe last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them.\r\nAnd now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still.\r\nWhat? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves.\r\nWhere you headed? To Honey Farms.\r\nI am onto something huge here.\r\nI'm going to Alaska.\r\nMoose blood, crazy stuff.\r\nBlows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma.\r\n- And you? - He really is dead.\r\nAll right.\r\nUh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell.\r\nBut don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming.\r\nTurn off the radio.\r\nWhassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood.\r\nJust a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.\r\nWow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.\r\nI mean, that honey's ours.\r\n- Bees hang tight.\r\n- We're all jammed in.\r\nIt's a close community.\r\nNot us, man.\r\nWe on our own.\r\nEvery mosquito on his own.\r\n- What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.\r\nNobody likes us.\r\nThey just smack.\r\nSee a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world.\r\nYou must meet girls.\r\nMosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.\r\nMosquito girl don't want no mosquito.\r\nYou got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here.\r\nDid you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.\r\nWhat is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.\r\nThey are pinheads! Pinhead.\r\n- Oheck out the new smoker.\r\n- Oh, sweet.\r\nThat's the one you want.\r\nThe Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.\r\nTwice the nicotine, all the tar.\r\nA couple breaths of this knocks them right out.\r\nThey make the honey, and we make the money.\r\n\"They make the honey, and we make the money\"? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah.\r\nIt doesn't last too long.\r\nDo you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here.\r\nWe had no choice.\r\nThis is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey.\r\nOur honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.\r\nOh, Barry, stop.\r\nWho told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.\r\nDo these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory.\r\nThese are obviously doctored photos.\r\nHow did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans.\r\n- What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend.\r\nAnd they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not.\r\n- You wish you could.\r\n- Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.\r\nThose crazy legs kept me up all night.\r\nBarry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives.\r\nNobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring.\r\nYou couldn't stop.\r\nI remember that.\r\nWhat right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year.\r\nThey put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts.\r\nIn the face! The eye! - That would hurt.\r\n- No.\r\nUp the nose? That's a killer.\r\nThere's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.\r\nHive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.\r\nNo more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.\r\nWeather with Storm Stinger.\r\nSports with Buzz Larvi.\r\nAnd Jeanette Ohung.\r\n- Good evening.\r\nI'm Bob Bumble.\r\n- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.\r\nA tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.\r\nTonight we're talking to Barry Benson.\r\nDid you ever think, \"I'm a kid from the hive.\r\nI can't do this\"? Bees have never been afraid to change the world.\r\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\r\nWe were thinking of stickball or candy stores.\r\nHow old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.\r\nYou know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.\r\nIt's a common name.\r\nNext week...\r\nHe looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...\r\nNext week...\r\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.\r\nBear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.\r\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.\r\nIn tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken.\r\nShe's 81.\r\nHoney, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please.\r\nActual work going on here.\r\n- Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race.\r\n- Hello.\r\n- Hello, bee.\r\nThis is Ken.\r\nYeah, I remember you.\r\nTimberland, size ten and a half.\r\nVibram sole, I believe.\r\nWhy does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.\r\nBut it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye.\r\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing.\r\nYou two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.\r\n- Frosting...\r\n- How many sugars? Just one.\r\nI try not to use the competition.\r\nSo why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities.\r\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\r\nInstead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.\r\nThose are great, if you're three.\r\nAnd artificial flowers.\r\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.\r\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\r\nBees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.\r\nMaybe this could make up for it a little bit.\r\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\r\n- I guess.\r\nYou sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.\r\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.\r\nYou think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.\r\n- What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.\r\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\r\nYou boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.\r\nAll right.\r\nOase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v.\r\nthe Honey Industry is now in session.\r\nMr.\r\nMontgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege.\r\nMr.\r\nBenson...\r\nyou're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding.\r\nYes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.\r\nMr.\r\nMontgomery, your opening statement, please.\r\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman.\r\nBorn on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.\r\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr.\r\nBenson imagines, just think of what would it mean.\r\nI would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr.\r\nBenson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.\r\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\r\nHoney's pretty important to me.\r\nIt's important to all bees.\r\nWe invented it! We make it.\r\nAnd we protect it with our lives.\r\nUnfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time.\r\nSo nice! Oall your first witness.\r\nSo, Mr.\r\nKlauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.\r\nI suppose so.\r\nI see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.\r\nBeekeeper.\r\nI find that to be a very disturbing term.\r\nI don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No.\r\n- I couldn't hear you.\r\n- No.\r\n- No.\r\nBecause you don't free bees.\r\nYou keep bees.\r\nNot only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.\r\nThey're very lovable creatures.\r\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\r\nYou mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough.\r\nTake him away.\r\nSo, Mr.\r\nSting, thank you for being here.\r\nYour name intrigues me.\r\n- Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.\r\nBut you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't.\r\nNo, you haven't.\r\nAnd so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.\r\nOh, please.\r\nHave you ever been stung, Mr.\r\nSting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.\r\nOr should I say...\r\nMr.\r\nGordon M.\r\nSumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr.\r\nLiotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.\r\nThank you.\r\nThank you.\r\nI see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.\r\nI enjoy what I do.\r\nIs that a crime? Not yet it isn't.\r\nBut is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella.\r\nThis is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr.\r\nLiotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.\r\nI think the jury's on our side.\r\nAre we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist.\r\nRight.\r\nWell, here's to a great team.\r\nTo a great team! Well, hello.\r\n- Ken! - Hello.\r\nI didn't think you were coming.\r\nNo, I was just late.\r\nI tried to call, but...\r\nthe battery.\r\nI didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry.\r\nLuckily, he was free.\r\nOh, that was lucky.\r\nThere's a little left.\r\nI could heat it up.\r\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\r\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\r\nI'm not much for the game myself.\r\nThe ball's a little grabby.\r\nThat's where I usually sit.\r\nRight...\r\nthere.\r\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.\r\nYou think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob.\r\nWe have that in common.\r\nDo we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.\r\nThat's just what I was thinking about doing.\r\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz.\r\nI hope that was all right.\r\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\r\nYeah, you do that.\r\nLook at that.\r\nYou know, I've just about had it with your little mind games.\r\n- What's that? - Italian Vogue.\r\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\r\nA lot of ads.\r\nRemember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers.\r\nHow do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much.\r\nWater bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing.\r\n- Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly.\r\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life.\r\nAnd you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\r\nMy nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken.\r\nAnd for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that.\r\nI know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.\r\nI couldn't overcome it.\r\nOh, well.\r\nAre you OK for the trial? I believe Mr.\r\nMontgomery is about out of ideas.\r\nWe would like to call Mr.\r\nBarry Benson Bee to the stand.\r\nGood idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...\r\nYeah.\r\nLayton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.\r\nDon't worry.\r\nThe only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.\r\n- You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son.\r\nOnly to losing.\r\nMr.\r\nBenson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.\r\nWhat exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends.\r\n- Good friends? - Yes.\r\nHow good? Do you live together? Wait a minute...\r\nAre you her little...\r\n...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two.\r\nFrom what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but...\r\n- So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry...\r\n- Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me.\r\n- I can't feel my legs.\r\nWhat angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court.\r\nOrder! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T.\r\nMontgomery.\r\n- Hey, buddy.\r\n- Hey.\r\n- Is there much pain? - Yeah.\r\nI...\r\nI blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter.\r\nWhat matters is you're alive.\r\nYou could have died.\r\nI'd be better off dead.\r\nLook at me.\r\nThey got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\r\nLook, there's a little celery still on it.\r\nWhat was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it.\r\nIt was all...\r\nAll adrenaline and then...\r\nand then ecstasy! All right.\r\nYou think it was all a trap? Of course.\r\nI'm sorry.\r\nI flew us right into this.\r\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us.\r\nWe're just a couple of bugs in this world.\r\nWhat will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know.\r\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\r\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\r\nAdam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my.\r\nOould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke.\r\nBees don't smoke.\r\nRight.\r\nBees don't smoke.\r\nBees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.\r\nThat's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed.\r\nI've gotta go somewhere.\r\nGet back to the court and stall.\r\nStall any way you can.\r\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\r\nMr.\r\nFlayman.\r\nYes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.\r\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.\r\nI actually heard a funny story about...\r\nYour Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.\r\nI move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr.\r\nFlayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr.\r\nMontgomery's motion.\r\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\r\nWhere is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.\r\nWhat is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.\r\nLook at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.\r\nLadies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry.\r\nI'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees.\r\nNow we won't have to work so hard all the time.\r\nThis is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.\r\nYou'll regret this.\r\nBarry, how much honey is out there? All right.\r\nOne at a time.\r\nBarry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.\r\n- What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.\r\nOongratulations on your victory.\r\nWhat will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.\r\nThen we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.\r\nWe demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.\r\nWe're all aware of what they do in the woods.\r\nWait for my signal.\r\nTake him out.\r\nHe'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.\r\nAnd we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...\r\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.\r\nOan't breathe.\r\nBring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good.\r\nTap it.\r\nMr.\r\nBuzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.\r\nShut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort.\r\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\r\nReturning to base.\r\nAdam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.\r\nOh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home.\r\nThey don't know what to do.\r\nLaying out, sleeping in.\r\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.\r\nAt least we got our honey back.\r\nSometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.\r\nThis was my new desk.\r\nThis was my new job.\r\nI wanted to do it really well.\r\nAnd now...\r\nNow I can't.\r\nI don't understand why they're not happy.\r\nI thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing.\r\nIt's amazing.\r\nHoney really changes people.\r\nYou don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This.\r\nWhat happened here? That is not the half of it.\r\nOh, no.\r\nOh, my.\r\nThey're all wilting.\r\nDoesn't look very good, does it? No.\r\nAnd whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees.\r\nBees? Specifically, me.\r\nI didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.\r\nIt's notjust flowers.\r\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\r\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\r\nTake away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.\r\nAnd then, of course...\r\nThe human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault.\r\nHow about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me.\r\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\r\nRight, right.\r\nListen, Barry...\r\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\r\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\r\nVanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.\r\nThey've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.\r\nIt's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.\r\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\r\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\r\nI know.\r\nMe neither.\r\nTournament of Roses.\r\nRoses can't do sports.\r\nWait a minute.\r\nRoses.\r\nRoses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.\r\nFlowers, bees, pollen! I know.\r\nThat's why this is the last parade.\r\nMaybe not.\r\nOould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake.\r\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\r\nYes, it kind of is.\r\nI've ruined the planet.\r\nI wanted to help you with the flower shop.\r\nI've made it worse.\r\nActually, it's completely closed down.\r\nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\r\nBut I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.\r\nI don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.\r\nI know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.\r\nAll we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.\r\n- Bees.\r\n- Park.\r\n- Pollen! - Flowers.\r\n- Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.\r\nThey've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.\r\nSecurity will be tight.\r\nI have an idea.\r\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\r\nOfficial floral business.\r\nIt's real.\r\nSorry, ma'am.\r\nNice brooch.\r\nThank you.\r\nIt was a gift.\r\nOnce inside, we just pick the right float.\r\nHow about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it.\r\n- Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea.\r\n- The pea? It goes under the mattresses.\r\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\r\n- I'm getting the marshal.\r\nYou do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do.\r\nHey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic...\r\n...without arousing suspicion.\r\nOnce at the airport, there's no stopping us.\r\nStop! Security.\r\n- You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.\r\nHas it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger.\r\n- It's part of me.\r\nI know.\r\nJust having some fun.\r\nEnjoy your flight.\r\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.\r\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work.\r\nIt's got to work.\r\nAttention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.\r\nWe have a bit of bad weather in New York.\r\nIt looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.\r\nBarry, these are cut flowers with no water.\r\nThey'll never make it.\r\nI gotta get up there and talk to them.\r\nBe careful.\r\nOan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\r\nOaptain, I'm in a real situation.\r\n- What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.\r\nBee! Don't freak out! My entire species...\r\nWhat are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move.\r\nOh, Barry.\r\nGood afternoon, passengers.\r\nThis is your captain.\r\nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.\r\nOne's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\r\nWhat's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome.\r\nI'm a florist from New York.\r\nWhere's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.\r\nNot good.\r\nDoes anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is.\r\n- Who's that? - Barry Benson.\r\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\r\nVanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.\r\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\r\nI can't fly a plane.\r\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.\r\nHow hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.\r\nThis is Bob Bumble.\r\nWe have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.\r\nBarry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...\r\nThat's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.\r\nFlowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.\r\nJust a minute.\r\nThere's a bee on that plane.\r\nI'm quite familiar with Mr.\r\nBenson and his no-account compadres.\r\nThey've done enough damage.\r\nBut isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.\r\nTheir wings are too small...\r\nHaven't we heard this a million times? \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\" - Get this on the air! - Got it.\r\n- Stand by.\r\n- We're going live.\r\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\r\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.\r\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\r\nIf you do it well, it makes a big difference.\r\nMore than we realized.\r\nTo us, to everyone.\r\nThat's why I want to get bees back to working together.\r\nThat's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.\r\nWe get behind a fellow.\r\n- Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover.\r\n- Hover? - Forget hover.\r\nThis isn't so hard.\r\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.\r\n- That may have been helping me.\r\n- And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\r\nAll of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell.\r\nI'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.\r\nIt's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice! It's not a tone.\r\nI'm panicking! I can't do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together.\r\nYou have to snap out of it! You snap out of it.\r\nYou snap out of it.\r\n- You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it! - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\r\nHow is the plane flying? I don't know.\r\nHello? Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? The Pollen Jocks! They do get behind a fellow.\r\n- Black and yellow.\r\n- Hello.\r\nAll right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.\r\nWhere? I can't see anything.\r\nOan you? No, nothing.\r\nIt's all cloudy.\r\nOome on.\r\nYou got to think bee, Barry.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\n- Thinking bee.\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Wait a minute.\r\nI think I'm feeling something.\r\n- What? - I don't know.\r\nIt's strong, pulling me.\r\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\r\nBring the nose down.\r\nThinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! - Vanessa, aim for the flower.\r\n- OK.\r\nOut the engines.\r\nWe're going in on bee power.\r\nReady, boys? Affirmative! Good.\r\nGood.\r\nEasy, now.\r\nThat's it.\r\nLand on that flower! Ready? Full reverse! Spin it around! - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one? - That flower.\r\n- I'm aiming at the flower! That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\r\nI mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees! Pull forward.\r\nNose down.\r\nTail up.\r\nRotate around it.\r\n- This is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.\r\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there.\r\nDon't be afraid.\r\nSmell it.\r\nFull reverse! Just drop it.\r\nBe a part of it.\r\nAim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already.\r\nBarry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes.\r\nNo high-five! - Right.\r\nBarry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you.\r\n- But we're not done yet.\r\nListen, everyone! This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.\r\nThat means this is our last chance.\r\nWe're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.\r\nIf we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say? Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains? We're bees! Keychain! Then follow me! Except Keychain.\r\nHold on, Barry.\r\nHere.\r\nYou've earned this.\r\nYeah! I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit.\r\nAll I gotta do are the sleeves.\r\nOh, yeah.\r\nThat's our Barry.\r\nMom! The bees are back! If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.\r\nI got a feeling we'll be working late tonight! Here's your change.\r\nHave a great afternoon! Oan I help who's next? Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved.\r\nDon't forget these.\r\nMilk, cream, cheese, it's all me.\r\nAnd I don't see a nickel! Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat! I had no idea.\r\nBarry, I'm sorry.\r\nHave you got a moment? Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.\r\nSorry I'm late.\r\nHe's a lawyer too? I was already a blood-sucking parasite.\r\nAll I needed was a briefcase.\r\nHave a great afternoon! Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.\r\nNo problem, Vannie.\r\nJust leave it to me.\r\nYou're a lifesaver, Barry.\r\nOan I help who's next? All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.\r\nThank you, Barry! That bee is living my life! Let it go, Kenny.\r\n- When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.\r\n- Beautiful day to fly.\r\n- Sure is.\r\nBetween you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.\r\nYou have got to start thinking bee, my friend.\r\n- Thinking bee! - Me? Hold it.\r\nLet's just stop for a second.\r\nHold it.\r\nI'm sorry.\r\nI'm sorry, everyone.\r\nOan we stop here? I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!

The component that I was in charge of would be capable of making complex queries, displaying results in a modular and configurable way, and editing field values and relationships robustly and intuitively, amongst other things.\r\n            The main challenge was to create this component to be highly configurable for a wide variety of applications including a staff and student account and relationship management system, a desk allocation system, and a software license tracking system. These applications were to be developed by other teams at the School of Engineering and so I was working closely with them to fulfill the requirements.\r\n            The technology stack for these projects is:\r\n            • Pyramid-Python backend with the pyramid-jsonapi library\r\n            • PostgreSQL database\r\n            • RESTful API (JSON API)\r\n            • Vue and Vuex frontend with the jsonapi-vuex library\r\n\r\n            See these slides for a good visual explaination of the main features:\r\n            $lnk https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hC0ARHAVeDWvg32CgGt-9TvGQ4KT9Dvw-lKLDy_WSjg\r\n\r\n            $b GitHub:\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/uoe-eng/SearchListDetail-Component\r\n\r\n            $b Preview:\r\n            $img engineering.jpg\r\n\r\n            $b Related:\r\n            $lnk https://jsonapi.org\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/colinhiggs/pyramid-jsonapi\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/mrichar1/jsonapi-vuex\r\n\r\n            $b Go back\r\n            $cmd work\r\n            $cmd home\r\n            `\r\n        ))\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    trapit: () => {\r\n        store.dispatch(\"pushBlock\", parse(\r\n            `

Our robot was capable of scanning the state of any chess board, querying a chess AI for a move to play, then send instructions to a robotic arm to execute the move. We trained a machine learning classifier running on a server to recognise the positions of the pieces on the board, and used a RESTful API to talk to the Raspberry Pi to execute arm movement. My main task was to write code to interface with the robotic arm. Our robot won second place out of 22 groups.\r\n\r\n            $b General overview of software tasks:\r\n            • Find the boundaries of the chess board (most chess boards work)\r\n            • Segment the image into 64 squares\r\n            • Train a machine learning model to recognise if a square contains a white, black or no chess piece\r\n            • Infer the new board state using this new information and previous board states\r\n            • Query a chess AI for a move to play\r\n            • Convert the move to a series of movements to control the robotic arm\r\n            • Create a text-to-speech and speech-to-text interface in different languages to control the game\r\n\r\n            $b Links:\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/nogamesEd/plans/blob/master/Technical_report.pdf\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/nogamesEd/pi\r\n\r\n            $b Images:\r\n            $img chess_1.jpg\r\n            $img chess_2.jpg\r\n\r\n            $b Go back\r\n            $cmd work\r\n            $cmd home\r\n            `\r\n        ))\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    projects: () => {\r\n        store.dispatch(\"pushBlock\", parse(\r\n            `

The app works by reading from a library of wav files (samples of drums or instrument notes), and combining them into a new wav file. By using a bit of music theory, the chord sequence that is generated is guaranteed to sound musical, and is taken into account when the melody is created so that there are no musical clashes. Various displays show the created melody and chord sequence, and when the user is happy with their creation, it can be exported to .wav or .midi files. Creating .wav and .midi files from scratch requires an understanding of their file structures and headers, which was challenging.\r\n\r\n            $b Feature overview:\r\n            • Chords are generated using Scale Degrees, and so are guaranteed to sound musical\r\n            • If the user does not like a chord, they can re-generate a single chord leaving the rest untouched, or they can specify the chord entirely manually\r\n            • Melody is generated based on the chord sequence to ensure that there are no musical clashes\r\n            • Export to .wav or .midi files for use in other programs, and continue composition\r\n            • Graphical display to show the generated melody in a piano roll style\r\n            • Drums are set to have a slight swing, giving the generated clip the classic \"House\" feeling\r\n            • With the drums overlayed, the track will have \"ducking\" applied to it - a process in which the instruments' volume is quickly lowered and brought back up to make the kick drum stand out\r\n\r\n            $b GitHub:\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/felixxwu/Music-Generator\r\n\r\n            $b Preview:\r\n            $img music_generator.jpg\r\n\r\n            $b Related:\r\n            $cmd chordgenerator\r\n\r\n            $b Go back\r\n            $cmd projects\r\n            $cmd home\r\n            `\r\n        ))\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    chordgenerator: () => {\r\n        store.dispatch(\"pushBlock\", parse(\r\n            `

Unlike the house music generator, these chords are completely random, allowing weird and interesting chords to inspire the user. Chords can be played at the click of a button and a MIDI sequence can be exported to use in any music program. When a chord needs to be played, the app reads from wav files (each a single piano note sound) to combine into a single wav file to play to the user, when the user is happy with the chord sequence, they can export it to a MIDI file.\r\n\r\n            $b Feature overview:\r\n            • Create up to 8 randomly generated chords, with four notes each\r\n            • Adjust the length of each chord\r\n            • Add and remove chords from a \"favourites\" library to increase the likelyhood of that chord appearing\r\n            • Transpose a chord up and down to make adjustments\r\n            • Edit individual notes in a chord to make even finer adjustments\r\n            • Play individual chords or let the whole chord sequence play\r\n            • Export the chord sequence, complete with chord lengths to MIDI, and build on it in another application\r\n            \r\n            $b GitHub:\r\n            $lnk https://github.com/felixxwu/Chord-Generator\r\n\r\n            $b Preview:\r\n            $img chord_generator.jpg\r\n\r\n            $b Related:\r\n            $cmd housegenerator\r\n\r\n            $b Go back\r\n            $cmd projects\r\n            $cmd home\r\n            `\r\n        ))\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    sudoku: () => {\r\n        store.dispatch(\"pushBlock\", parse(\r\n            `

This is much quicker than setting the hours and minutes individually from a clock face or dropdown list. It features two modes: alarm and timer mode. In alarm mode, inputting \"730\" would create an alarm for 7:30am. In timer mode, inputting \"730\" would set an alarm 7 hours and 30 minutes from now.\r\n\r\n            $b Play Store:\r\n            $lnk https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wu.felix.alarmtimer\r\n\r\n            $b Preview:\r\n            $img android_alarm.jpg\r\n\r\n            $b Go back\r\n            $cmd projects\r\n            $cmd home\r\n            `\r\n        ))\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    ultrasound: () => {\r\n        store.dispatch(\"pushBlock\", parse(\r\n            `

A smartphone, or other device, can however pick up a limited amount of audio in the ultrasonic (20khz+) range. The recorded audio can be analysed and decoded, and the URL can be extracted.\r\n            We think that this is a novel alternative to QR codes, where the encoded ultrasonic URL will be played in a loop somewhere.

The messages are encrypted using a symmetric AES cipher.\r\n\r\n            $b Feature overview:\r\n            • Enter a chat room using a previously agreed and secure password\r\n            • Using Websockets, messages can be sent and received in real-time\r\n            • Messages are encrypted symmetrically using AES\r\n            • Messages arrive hidden, and when they are opened they are deleted after a timer reaches zero\r\n\r\n            $b Link:\r\n            $lnk https://chat-secure.herokuapp.com/\r\n\r\n            $b Preview:\r\n            $img encrypted_chat.jpg\r\n\r\n            $b Go back\r\n            $cmd projects\r\n            $cmd home\r\n            `\r\n        ))\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    courses: () => {\r\n        store.dispatch(\"pushBlock\", parse(\r\n            `
