  A naughts and crosses game that you can play between two devices in real-time. It uses your device's location to find games nearest to you so you know which ones to connect to.
  This project really served as a way for me to familiarize myself with React.js, Node.js and Websockets. Its a proof of concept and learning experience to show that a game can be played in real-time, and a lot of the code will be repurposed for other projects.
