  Noxive is my alias for my electronic music production hobby. So far I have gained over 500k views across YouTube, SoundCloud and Spotify, and generated a small income of $600 from royalties and other paid work. I have had the opportunity to collaborate with many talented artists over the last few years, improving my communication and feedback skills.
  <br>
  The landing page <a href="https://noxive.com" target="_blank">noxive.com</a> features links to my social media, discography, and a built-in music player. I advertise this site anywhere I can because it has proven to serve well as an entry point for anyone looking for Noxive social media accounts or releases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Website feature overview:
  <ul>
    <li>An elegant and dynamic list of all Noxive releases</li>
    <li>Links to relevant social media accounts and a small about section</li>
    <li>A built-in music player for each release</li>
    <li>A list of platforms where the release can be found (Spotify, YouTube, etc.)</li>
    <li>Data pulled from a Firebase database, making it very easy to add new releases</li>
    <li>The tag under a release can be clicked to show all releases with the same tag</li>
  </ul>
