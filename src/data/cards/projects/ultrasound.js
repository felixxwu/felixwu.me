  This Java app allows you to encode text into a wav file, which if played on a speaker will produce ultrasound which cannot be perceived by humans. A smartphone, or other device, can however pick up a limited amount of audio in the ultrasonic (20khz+) range. The recorded audio can be analysed and decoded, and the URL can be extracted.
  <br>
  We think that this is a novel alternative to QR codes, where the encoded ultrasonic URL will be played in a loop somewhere. Surrounding smartphones can then detect the URL and send the user to a page - no need to launch the camera and point it anywhere.
