  Owme is the reincarnation of FlatApp, improving on the shortcomings thereof. With the additional option to sign in with Google, you can quickly interact with anyone on Owme, even people outside your group. You can create any number of groups with your friends to get a quick overview of your net debt with the group, on top of the debts with individuals. The improved design now allows you to easily create a debt with a friend, selection of friends, or group, in a much more intuitive way. The PayPal integration is also improved, taking advantage of the paypal.me system.

  Both FlatApp and Owme were used extensively by my flatmates and I during the first and second years of University, to manage debts from bills and groceries.

  Feature overview:
  <ul>
    <li>A clean and dynamic, single-page design</li>

  </ul>
