  A 3-month long internship for the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, in which I worked with the IT Team to build the foundations of the new user interface for various database management related internal applications. The component that I was in charge of would be capable of making complex queries, displaying results in a modular and configurable way, and editing field values and relationships robustly and intuitively, amongst other things.
  <br>
  The main challenge was to create this component to be highly configurable for a wide variety of applications that would be developed in the future by other teams at the School of Engineering and so I was working closely with them to fulfill the requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology stack for these projects was:
  <ul>
    <li>Pyramid-Python backend with the pyramid-jsonapi library</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL database</li>
    <li>RESTful API (JSON API)</li>
    <li>Vue and Vuex frontend with the jsonapi-vuex library</li>
  </ul>
