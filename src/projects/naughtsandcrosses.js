    $h1 NAUGHTS AND CROSS>ES WEB APP

    A naughts and crosses game that you can play between two devices in real-time. It uses your device's location to find games nearest to you so you know which ones to connect to.
    More than anything, this project really served as a way for me to familiarise myself with React.js, Node.js and css animations. Its a proof of concept and learning experience to show that a game can be played in real-time, and a lot of the code will be repurposed for Second Wind.

    $b Feature overview:
    • Real-time naughts and crosses gameplay using Websockets on a Node.js backend
    • Optional location access to making joining a game easier
    • Real-time online/offline status for the enemy player
