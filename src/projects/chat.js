    A secure and anonymous one-to-one chat with self-deleting messages. The messages are encrypted using a symmetric AES cipher.This was an excercise to test and advance my knowledge of web security and encryption, and was also a good opportunity to learn how to use websockets.
    
    $b Feature overview:
    • Enter a chat room using a previously agreed and secure password
    • Using Websockets, messages can be sent and received in real-time
    • Messages are encrypted symmetrically using AES
    • Messages arrive hidden, and when they are opened they are deleted after a timer reaches zero
