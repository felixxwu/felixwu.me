    $h1 NOXIVE.COM

    A landing page for Noxive, serving also as temporary host for other web-based projects. It features links to my social media, discography, and a built-in music player. I advertise this site anywhere I can because it has proven to serve well as an entry point for anyone looking for a particular Noxive social media account or release.

    $b Feature overview:
    • An elegant and dynamic list of all Noxive releases
    • Links to relevant social media accounts and a small about section
    • A built-in music player for each release
    • A list of platforms where the release can be found (Spotify, YouTube, etc.)
    • Data pulled from a Firebase database, making it very easy to add new releases
    • The tag under a release can be clicked to show all releases with the same tag
