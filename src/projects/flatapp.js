    $h1 FLAT>APP

    FlatApp is a web app that allows groups of people to keep track of their debts with each other for things like groceries and bills. It features PayPal integration, making it easy to settle up any debts, however it is possible to use FlatApp without ever using it since it automatically cancels out the debts. It also features a communal shopping list where a debt is created automatically with whoever put up the item, or, if the item is communal, splits the debt automatically between all group members.

    $b Feature overview:
    • Create an account associated with a group of friends
    • Create and track your debts with individuals in the group
    • Pay off your debts easily with a handy PayPal button
    • Or pay off your debts by putting other people's debts on the app
    • Post something on the communal shopping list in case someone is at the shops
    • Watch as a debt is automatically created with someone as you check off something you bought from the shopping list
    • Save calculating the split cost of a communal item, and watch automatic debts be created with all group memebers
    • Pin something passively aggressive on the message board if your flatmates haven't done the dishes!
