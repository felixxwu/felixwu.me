    (2019)

    A 3-month long internship for the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, in which I worked with the IT Team to build the foundations of the new user interface for various database management related internal applications. The component that I was in charge of would be capable of making complex queries, displaying results in a modular and configurable way, and editing field values and relationships robustly and intuitively, amongst other things.
    The main challenge was to create this component to be highly configurable for a wide variety of applications including a staff and student account and relationship management system, a desk allocation system, and a software license tracking system. These applications were to be developed by other teams at the School of Engineering and so I was working closely with them to fulfill the requirements.
    The technology stack for these projects is:
    • Pyramid-Python backend with the pyramid-jsonapi library
    • PostgreSQL database
    • RESTful API (JSON API)
    • Vue and Vuex frontend with the jsonapi-vuex library

    See these slides for a good visual explaination of the main features:
