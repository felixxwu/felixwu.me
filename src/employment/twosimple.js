    (2020 - Now)

    2Simple has given me the opportunity to take ownership of a number of projects over the years. The following are the three main projects that I took over or created:

    • Implemented major updates to all areas of the app “2Publish” - the 3rd most used web app on the platform with over 1M hits/mo. The redesigned interface and additional functionality allowed users to work with the app more effectively and intuitively. User feedback was very positive and support cases were fewer than expected, given the size of the update.

    • Created a new app “PDF Annotator” for the platform, used by many teachers to create activity sheets and online homework assignments.

    • Implemented a redesigned interface for the app “2Create A Story” - the 7th most used web app on the platform with 500k hits/mo. The long-overdue modernisation was well received by customers.
