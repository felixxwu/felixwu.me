to change where vue build outputs go:
yarn build --dest "folder"

to change <%= BASE_URL %> in public/index.html:
create a file called vue.config.js with
module.exports = { publicPath: "/subfolder/" }

current setup:
subfolders can be vue projects, they are setup to be deployed as subdirectories
subfolders like _bpm/ are set to build into public/bpm/ using "yarn build --dest ../public/bpm"
they are also set to fetch resources using a /bpm/ path before the link
so in public/bpm/index.html you have things like src="/bpm/app.js"
then when you yarn build from / the contents of public/ are copied to dist/ including public/bpm/
now dist/bpm/index.html links files properly
